# flask-json-formatter

I use this application to nicely format HTTP request and response data from the Chrome Developer Console for web scraping in Python. It works nicely for headers, query string parameters, form data, etc.

I developed this using Python's Flask framework and deployed it with the Google App Engine [here](https://flask-json-formatter.appspot.com/).
