# flask-json-formatter

I use this application to nicely format HTTP request data from the Chrome Developer Console for web scraping in Python. It works nicely for headers, query string parameters, form data, etc.

I developed this using the Flask framework and deployed it on Google App Engine [here](https://flask-json-formatter.appspot.com/).
